# MintNotify - Notifications for Intuit Mint (Use at your own risk.)
Tired of having to constantly check my accounts after every paycheck to see if money landed in my After-tax 401k (mega backdoor roth). MintNotify checks my account for me through [mintapi](https://github.com/mrooney/mintapi) and sends me an email if the balance of specified accounts changed by a user-defined threshold. It also keeps all your accounts updated in Mint so the notifications aren't delayed. 


2/28/2021 - Added basic support for BTC and ETH. [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/) can easily add support for cryptos but it's been a while... ðŸ˜ž 

Hosted on Heroku with a scheduler.
