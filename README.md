# MintNotify - Notifications for Intuit Mint (Under development. Use at your own risk.)
Tired of having to constantly check my accounts after every paycheck to see if money landed in my HSA/After-tax 401k (mega backdoor roth). MintNotify checks my account for me through [mintapi](https://github.com/mrooney/mintapi) and sends me an email if the balance of specified accounts changed by a user-defined threshold. 

Hosted on Heroku with a scheduler.
