# MintNotify
Tired of having to constantly check my accounts after every paycheck to see if money landed in my HSA/After-tax 401k (mega backdoor roth). MintNotify checks my account for me through [mintapi](https://github.com/mrooney/mintapi) and sends me an email if the balance of specified accounts' balance changed by a certain threshold. 

Hosted on Heroku with a scheduler.

# Current Savings Goals
1. Max out 401k
2. Max out HSA
3. Max out ESPP
4. Put as much as possible in mega backdoor roth 
5. Adjust above to make sure paycheck is just enough for necessities.
6. FIRE?
