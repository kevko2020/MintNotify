# MintNotify - Notifications for Intuit Mint (Under development. Use at your own risk.)
Tired of having to constantly check my accounts after every paycheck to see if money landed in my HSA/After-tax 401k (mega backdoor roth). MintNotify checks my account for me through [mintapi](https://github.com/mrooney/mintapi) and sends me an email if the balance of specified accounts changed by a user-defined threshold. 

Hosted on Heroku with a scheduler.

# Current Savings Goals
1. Max out 401k - 19.5k
2. Max out HSA - $3.5k
4. Max out Roth IRA or backdoor Roth IRA - $6k
3. Max out ESPP
4. Put as much as possible in mega backdoor roth - $33.5k max
5. Adjust above to make sure paycheck is just enough for necessities.
6. [FIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement)?
